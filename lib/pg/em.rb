    # == PostgreSQL EventMachine client
    #
    # Author:: Rafal Michalski
    #
    # {PG::EM::Client} is a PG::Connection[http://deveiate.org/code/pg/PG/Connection.html]
    # wrapper designed for EventMachine[http://rubyeventmachine.com/].
    #
    # The following new methods:
    #
    # - {#exec_defer} (alias: +query_defer+)
    # - {#exec_params_defer}
    # - {#prepare_defer}
    # - {#exec_prepared_defer}
    # - {#describe_prepared_defer}
    # - {#describe_portal_defer}
    # - {#get_result_defer}
    # - {#get_last_result_defer}
    #
    # are added to execute queries asynchronously,
    # returning +Deferrable+ object.
    #
    # The following methods of PG::Connection[http://deveiate.org/code/pg/PG/Connection.html]
    # are overloaded:
    #
    # - {#exec} (alias: +query+, +async_exec+, +async_query+)
    # - {#exec_params}
    # - {#prepare}
    # - {#exec_prepared}
    # - {#describe_prepared}
    # - {#describe_portal}
    # - {#get_result}
    # - {#get_last_result}
    #
    # and are now auto-detecting if EventMachine is running and
    # performing commands asynchronously (blocking only current fiber) or
    # calling parent thread-blocking methods.
    #
    # If {#async_autoreconnect} option is set to +true+, all of the above
    # methods (in asynchronous mode) try to re-connect after a connection
    # error occurs. It's performed behind the scenes, so no error is raised,
    # except if there was a transaction in progress. In such instance the error
    # is raised after establishing connection to signal that
    # the transaction was aborted.
    #
    # If you want to detect auto re-connect event use {#on_autoreconnect}
    # property/option.
    #
    # To enable auto-reconnecting set:
    #   client.async_autoreconnect = true
    #
    # or pass as {new} hash argument:
    #   PG::EM::Client.new dbname: 'bar', async_autoreconnect: true
    #
    # There are also new methods:
    #
    # - {Client.connect_defer}
    # - {#reset_defer}
    #
    # which are asynchronous versions of PG::Connection.new and
    # PG:Connection#reset.
    #
    # Additionally the following methods are overloaded:
    #
    # - {new} (alias: +connect+, +open+, +setdb+, +setdblogin+ )
    # - {#reset}
    #
    # providing auto-detecting asynchronous (fiber-synchronized) or
    # thread-blocking methods for (re)connecting.
    #
    # Otherwise nothing changes in PG::Connection API.
    # See PG::Connection[http://deveiate.org/code/pg/PG/Connection.html] docs
    # for explanation of arguments to the above methods.
    #
    # *Warning:*
    #
    # {#describe_prepared} and {#exec_prepared} after
    # {#prepare} should only be invoked on the *same* connection.
    # If you are using a {ConnectionPool}, make sure to acquire a single
    # connection first or execute +prepare+ command on every connection
    # using +#on_connect+ hook.

      #     is called regardless of the connection's last transaction status.
      #   - +Exception+ object - is raised/passed back and the pending command
      #     is not sent.
      #   - +Deferrable+ object - the chosen action will depend on the returned

      # Calls to {#transaction} may be nested, however without sub-transactions
      # (save points). If the innermost transaction block raises an error
      # the transaction is rolled back to the state before the outermost
      # transaction began.
      #
      # This is an extension to the +PG::Connection#transaction+ method
      # as it does not support nesting in this way.
      #
      # The method is sensitive to the transaction status and will safely
      # rollback on any sql error even when it was catched by some rescue block.
      # But consider that rescuing any sql error within an utility method
      # is a bad idea.
      #
      # This method works in both blocking/async modes (regardles of the reactor state)
      # and is considered as a generic extension to the +PG::Connection#transaction+
      # method.
